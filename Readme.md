## 🔍 Supported Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - Simple, stable sorting algorithm
   - Great for educational purposes
   - Best for small datasets

2. **Selection Sort**
   - In-place comparison sort
   - Minimizes number of swaps
   - Useful when memory is limited

3. **Insertion Sort**
   - Efficient for small data sets
   - Adaptive algorithm
   - Works great with nearly sorted arrays

4. **Merge Sort**
   - Divide and conquer algorithm
   - Stable sorting
   - Consistent O(n log n) performance

5. **Quick Sort**
   - Highly efficient for large datasets
   - Widely used in practice
   - In-place sorting

6. **Heap Sort**
   - In-place sorting
   - No quadratic worst-case scenario
   - Efficient for large datasets

## 🛠️ Technical Features
